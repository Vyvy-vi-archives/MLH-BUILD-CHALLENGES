## Dictu is a simple, dynamically typed programming language.


### What is Dictu-?:
Dictu is a very small, simple, and dynamically typed programming language inspired by a book by Robert Nystrom. Dictu builds upon the concepts within the book and adds more features to the language.

Dictu means simplistic in Latin. This is the aim of the language: to be as simplistic, organized, and logical as humanly possible.
